# OpenAlex-CitedReferences
Use the OpenAlex API to pull and analyze cited references

This project uses Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and the OpenAlex API to collect, clean, and examine open data on cited references. 

Research questions include: 
- How often do researchers from a university cite a particular journal?
- What years are those cited references from, and when was the reference made?
- Does the usage justify paying for backfile access to a journal, or do our researchers tend to use more recent content?
